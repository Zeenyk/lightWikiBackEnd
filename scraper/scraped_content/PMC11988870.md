## Abstract

Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique
environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human
cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological
processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly
impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell
activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to
increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the
formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which
closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology
research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by
modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving
stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At
the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism,
endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid
dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably,
cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under
microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium
handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere
length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of
functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for
treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings
underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and
terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in
regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued
research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for
protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering
biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.

## 1\. Introduction

Microgravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible
gravitational forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments
designed to simulate this state [1,2]. In cellular biology, microgravity
presents a unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic
reduction in gravity—a fundamental factor that regulates numerous cellular
processes on Earth [3,4,5]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces
that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations,
impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular
signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including
proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [4,5,6].

Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space
stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital
platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced
technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity
conditions [1,7,8]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on
Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding
astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases [1,9,10].

This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of
microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and
applications for human health.

## 2\. Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and
Embase databases. Search terms were structured following the PICOT framework,
with the components defined as follows:

  * Population: Stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells.

  * Intervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions.

  * Comparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions.

  * Outcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health.

  * Timing: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024.

The research question, based on the PICO framework, was as follows:

> _“How does microgravity (including simulated conditions) affect stem cells,
> T cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells, and other biological cells
> compared to cells under normal gravity conditions, specifically in terms of
> cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ
> homeostasis, and immune health?”_

To ensure a comprehensive search, relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
terms were included. Key terms covered the study populations (e.g., stem
cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, bone cells),
conditions (e.g., microgravity, simulated microgravity, standard gravity), and
outcomes of interest (e.g., cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular
metabolism, organ homeostasis, immune health).

The literature search was performed in December 2024 and included publications
in English and Spanish. Eligible studies encompassed observational studies, in
vitro research, and experimental investigations that addressed the effects of
microgravity on critical biological processes. The retrieved results were
systematically categorized based on their focus, enabling a detailed analysis
of microgravity’s impact on different biological functions. The findings were
then contrasted with observations from cells maintained under standard gravity
conditions, providing a comprehensive comparison of cellular adaptations in
these environments.

## 3\. Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System

### 3.1. Alterations in Immune Cells

Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the
development, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body’s
defenses in space environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for
generating immune cells, show impaired differentiation into macrophages,
critical for infection control. Furthermore, an imbalance between M1 (pro-
inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair) macrophages disrupts the
immune system’s ability to handle infections and repair tissues [1,2].

Dendritic cells, pivotal in T lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation,
are also adversely affected. Key molecules such as the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show
reduced expression, diminishing dendritic cell functionality. Notably, brief
exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic cell activity;
however, this effect is not sustained over the long term [2].

Neutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced
functionality, impairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively.
B lymphocytes, responsible for humoral immunity, demonstrate decreased
proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly, natural killer (NK) cells,
critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity, limiting
their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [2,3] (Figure 1).

#### Figure 1.

Effects of microgravity on the human immune system. This figure illustrates
the complex impact of microgravity on various immune cell populations and key
molecular signaling pathways. Exposure to microgravity leads to significant
alterations in immune cell function, including a shift in macrophage
polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory
M2 phenotype. Dendritic cells exhibit a reduced capacity for antigen
presentation, while neutrophil numbers increase, but their functionality
declines. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells is
diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance. T cell activation,
proliferation, and cytokine production are also suppressed, accompanied by
decreased expression of IL-2R. At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts
critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade and the NF-
κB pathway, further contributing to immune dysregulation. These findings
highlight the widespread and multifaceted effects of microgravity on immune
system function, which may have implications for long-term space travel and
astronaut health.

### 3.2. Impact on T Cells

Microgravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting
activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin A—a
standard activator of resting T cells—revealed significant inhibition of
activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the effects
intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation
markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71
(iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [11,12].

CD4+ T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like
IL-2 and IFN-γ, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine
production compared to CD8+ T cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity
notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions, while CD8+ cells require longer
exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments [11,12].

Cytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells
exhibit decreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansion, and
IFN-γ, crucial for macrophage activation and antiviral defense. These
deficiencies indicate a reduced capacity of T cells to coordinate and amplify
immune responses [11].

Apoptosis of T cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset
of late apoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage
apoptosis and a reduction in early-stage apoptosis, indicating a faster
progression through apoptotic pathways compared to controls under normal
gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression of the Fas receptor in
CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which regulates
apoptosis through external signals [12,13,14] (Figure 1).

### 3.3. Impact on Key Molecular Pathways

At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways,
including RAS, ERK, and NF-κB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell
proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading
to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell
differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that
hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF-
κB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent
activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [1,4].

Research on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer
biology, including the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the
reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the regulation of key proteins such as
p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-κB (a regulator of immune responses and
inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in programmed cell
death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types. In
cell lines from breast (MCF-7), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers,
microgravity-induced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene
expression, particularly in molecules like E-cadherin (important for cell
adhesion and tumor invasion suppression), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin (a protein associated with
epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby affecting tumor
proliferation and dissemination [15,16].

## 4\. Impact on Cancer Biology

### 4.1. Cancer Stem Cells

The study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions
provides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with
profound implications for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs,
characterized by their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities,
contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, and metastasis [5,6].

In cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are
identified using specific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed
analysis. Under simulated microgravity, these cells exhibit significant
changes in morphology and growth patterns, including the formation of
multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic in
vivo tumor organization, offering a robust model for studying the effects of
microgravity on tumor biology [5,7,8].

Exposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased
apoptosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting
a shift toward differentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance,
potentially enhancing their susceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal
cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer, simulated microgravity has been
linked to increased expression of specific markers, reflecting alterations in
the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These changes
can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological
treatments [6,7,8] (Figure 2).

#### Figure 2.

[![Figure

[Open in a new tab](figure/ijms-26-03058-f002/)

Microgravity-induced changes in cancer. This figure illustrates the diverse
effects of microgravity on cancer cells, with a particular focus on cancer
stem cells (CSCs) and thyroid cancer. Exposure to microgravity has been shown
to increase apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells. It also
alters CSC properties, leading to a decrease in pluripotency markers and an
increase in differentiation. Additionally, microgravity induces structural
changes in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, which may influence
tumor progression. In thyroid cancer, microgravity reduces proliferation and
overall growth, while also diminishing the malignant phenotype in follicular
thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, despite these inhibitory effects,
microgravity appears to increase the susceptibility of cancer cells,
potentially enhancing their response to treatments, as suggested by the
syringe graphic. These findings highlight the complex and sometimes
counterintuitive influence of microgravity on cancer biology.

Microgravity modulates apoptosis, a key defense against abnormal cell
proliferation. Many cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis
due to altered mechanical forces, while some acquire stem-like properties,
enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy resistance [17,18]. Microgravity
also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), which mimic solid
tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation,
suggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity
downregulates adhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin, vinculin, paxillin),
weakening cell–cell interactions and potentially enhancing metastatic
potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing radiation exacerbates
DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells, highlighting
the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights
into cancer treatment [19,20,21,22].

Simulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV)
and random positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real
microgravity (r-µg) but with some differences. High-energy radiation with high
linear energy transfer (high LET) increases genomic instability and mutation
risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations [23,24].

In gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune
cells, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality,
compromising immunosurveillance and hindering cancer detection [25,26,27].

Recent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by
inhibiting NF-κB, reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to
limit tumor growth through reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway may slow tumor growth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to
therapies, become more vulnerable under microgravity, which also alters
extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA content, opening opportunities
for new biomarkers and targeted therapies [28].

The mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays a crucial role in cellular responses
to microgravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion,
offering potential therapeutic benefits, but these effects are
ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure and adhesion stability
in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure, but may
enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness [29].

At the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the
transcriptional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and
invasiveness. This effect depends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead
to resistance or diminished responsiveness to mechanical stimuli.
ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may limit tumor
aggressiveness but could pose a structural disadvantage for healthy tissues
during extended space missions [29].

### 4.2. Thyroid Cancer

Microgravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a
unique experimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of
cancer biology, particularly thyroid cancer [30,31,32,33]. For nearly two
decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded
valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under
conventional laboratory conditions.

In microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties
and organize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble
the physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models
for studying metastasis and evaluating novel targeted therapies [30,31].

Microgravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis,
cytoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are
critical for cell growth and proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer
cells exposed to microgravity have demonstrated a tendency to adopt a less
malignant phenotype. This suggests that microgravity conditions may induce
favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of thyroid cancer
[30,31].

The findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize
traditional oncology research approaches. They facilitate the identification
of key cellular alterations in cancer pathogenesis and support the development
of innovative therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes. Furthermore,
these investigations pave the way for novel preventive strategies and more
effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed under
microgravity [30,32].

## 5\. Impacts on Tissues and Organ Systems

### 5.1. Microvascular Endothelial Cells

Simulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells,
which play a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation,
angiogenesis, and vascular permeability [9,10].

Under normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical
stimuli to preserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity,
significant alterations are observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition
of cell proliferation, which delays the repair of damaged blood vessels.
Reduced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine crucial for the
inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and vascular
repair capacity [9,23].

Interestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a
critical mediator for blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is
linked to the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While
nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its dysregulation can lead to
pathological states, depending on the physiological context [9,23].

Research on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on
endothelial cell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein
endothelial cells, essential regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were
exposed to simulated microgravity for up to 72 h using an RPM, which
continuously rotates to nullify Earth’s gravitational vector [24].

After 24 h, notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were
observed, including a marked reduction in cell stiffness (Young’s modulus) and
viscosity. Specifically, cellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%,
reaching critical levels with a 75% reduction after 72 h. This loss of
rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external hemodynamic
stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of
endothelial dysfunction [23,24].

Additionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under
simulated microgravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped,
cells adopted a distinctly rounded phenotype after 24 h. The increase in
circularity—more than three times greater than that of control cells—indicates
significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could affect vascular
permeability and the cells’ ability to respond to mechanical stress over time
[23,34].

At the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with
substantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis
revealed a 65% reduction in actin filament levels and a 26% reduction in
β-tubulin, a protein critical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence
confirmed these findings, showing discontinuities in cortical actin filaments
and abnormal redistribution of microtubules, particularly around the nucleus.
These results highlight impaired structural integrity and suggest that
endothelial cells may have a compromised ability to respond to biomechanical
stimuli [23,34] (Figure 3).

#### Figure 3.

[![Figure

[Open in a new tab](figure/ijms-26-03058-f003/)

Structural and functional adaptations of tissues and organ systems in
microgravity environments. This figure illustrates the broad impact of
microgravity on various tissues and organ systems, highlighting key structural
and functional adaptations. Microvascular endothelial cells exhibit inhibited
proliferation, decreased IL-6 production, and increased nitric oxide (NO)
production. In the liver, microgravity alters hepatic metabolism, leading to
increased lipotoxicity, elevated angiopoietin levels, upregulation of lipid
metabolism genes, and dysregulation of immune response genes. Intestinal
homeostasis is also affected, with observed dysbiosis, endotoxemia, altered
bile acid content, and increased levels of intestinal stress hormones. In
terms of bone health and mechanotransduction, microgravity induces significant
bone mass loss, accompanied by a reduction in actin filaments and decreased
cell stiffness in osteoblasts. Kidney cells experience metabolic alterations,
including reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation,
alongside increased expression of fibronectin (FN1), MMP7, and TGFBI.
Reproductive cells are also impacted, with evidence of reduced egg quality,
the loss of polarization in granulosa cells, and a decrease in microvilli in
eggs. Additionally, cardiomyocytes exhibit increased maturation and
functionality, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium storage in
the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the formation of sarcomeres and Z-disks. These
findings collectively underscore the widespread and system-specific
alterations induced by microgravity, significantly influencing cellular
function and overall tissue homeostasis.

Endothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional
spheroids, which closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D
models are invaluable for studying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial
function, enabling more physiologically relevant investigations compared to
traditional 2D cultures [9,10,23].

Collectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial
physiology, influencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and
vascular regulation. These insights have implications for diseases such as
cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory disorders. They underscore the
need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during space missions and
explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth [9].

### 5.2. Hepatic Metabolism and Intestinal Homeostasis

Microgravity, a defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations,
profoundly impacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs,
particularly the liver. Experimental models using rhesus macaques have shown
that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant metabolic
alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These include lipid
accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting
the disruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the
importance of exploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in
animal models and future human studies [34,35,36] (Figure 3).

In a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques
developed mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell
infiltration. These hepatic changes were accompanied by a marked increase in
plasma levels of angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a key biomarker associated
with metabolic disorders and lipid dysregulation. These results suggest that
microgravity may induce hepatic lipotoxicity, a phenomenon previously
documented in rodents but requiring further investigation in primates and
humans to better understand its clinical relevance [34,35,36].

At the molecular level, transcriptomic analyses of liver samples from macaques
exposed to microgravity revealed overexpression of genes associated with lipid
metabolism and downregulation of genes linked to the innate immune response.
These molecular changes could impair the liver’s ability to manage metabolic
stress, a critical function for maintaining long-term health. Additionally,
disruptions in fatty acid metabolism were identified, potentially contributing
to lipid dysregulation associated with metabolic diseases such as diabetes and
obesity [34,35].

Another noteworthy finding was the impact of microgravity on the gut
microbiota, a key regulator of hepatic metabolism through the gut–liver axis.
Macaques subjected to the head-down bed rest model exhibited intestinal
dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and altered bile acid composition. These gut
alterations were accompanied by elevated levels of stress hormones, suggesting
systemic metabolic imbalance triggered by microgravity exposure [34,36].

The effects of microgravity on liver function and metabolic homeostasis carry
significant implications for space medicine. These findings highlight the need
to closely monitor liver function and the gut–liver axis during prolonged
space missions to mitigate potential health risks. Moreover, the metabolic
changes observed in animal models provide valuable insights into terrestrial
diseases such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This knowledge
could contribute to the development of more effective treatments and
innovative therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine, ultimately
benefiting both astronauts and the general population [34,35,36].

### 5.3. Bone Health and Mechanotransduction

Microgravity profoundly impacts the mechanotransduction of human osteoblasts.
Astronauts who spend prolonged periods in space experience accelerated bone
mass loss, making the International Space Station (ISS) an ideal platform for
studying the mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in zero-gravity conditions
[37,38,39].

In this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed,
including the use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell
spheroids. These advanced models enable researchers to investigate how the
absence of mechanical loading affects bone cell maturation and mineralization.
Studies have shown that microgravity decreases cell stiffness and reduces the
levels of filamentous actin, a cytoskeletal component critical for maintaining
cell tension and facilitating mechanotransduction. For example, experiments
conducted on the ISS using automated microfluidic devices have provided
valuable insights into the mechanical properties of human osteoblasts under
microgravity conditions [37,38,39] (Figure 3).

Results from these experiments reveal that osteoblasts exposed to microgravity
develop elongated protrusions compared to terrestrial samples, indicating a
phenomenon referred to as “cellular softening”. This structural change
correlates with a reduction in actin fiber density, consistent with findings
from prior studies conducted under simulated microgravity [40,41,42].

These structural and cytoskeletal alterations highlight disruptions in
mechanotransduction, the process through which cells sense and respond to
mechanical stimuli. Without the constant gravitational forces present on
Earth, osteoblasts lose the ability to maintain their tensional structure and
perform optimally, contributing to the bone demineralization observed in
astronauts [38,39].

Further research has utilized three-dimensional spheroid models, which better
replicate physiological conditions than traditional two-dimensional cell
cultures. Collagen-encapsulated osteoblast spheroids subjected to controlled
pressures under microgravity exhibited a reduction in the expression of key
mechanosensitive proteins, such as Yes-associated protein (YAP). This suggests
that microgravity disrupts mechanical signaling pathways critical for cellular
regulation and bone homeostasis [37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49].

Mechanotransduction is a crucial process by which cells sense and respond to
mechanical stimuli through interactions with the extracellular matrix. On
Earth, proteins like YAP/TAZ translate mechanical forces into gene expression
changes, modulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Under
microgravity, the diminished activity of YAP/TAZ leads to varying outcomes in
different cancers, such as reduced cell proliferation or increased
invasiveness due to altered mechanosignaling. Understanding these differential
responses could inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these
vulnerabilities [19,20,21,22].

Importantly, the application of compressive pressure partially restored YAP
expression and increased pSMAD1/5/9 levels, demonstrating that biomechanical
signals can reactivate essential molecular pathways, even under microgravity
conditions. These findings underscore the potential of mechanical
interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of microgravity on bone tissue
[39,40,41,43].

The implications of these studies are significant. They not only advance our
understanding of how microgravity influences cellular biology but also pave
the way for developing therapeutic strategies to combat bone loss in both
space environments and terrestrial patients with osteoporosis. Additionally,
the creation of devices that simulate mechanical loads could benefit
astronauts and individuals on Earth, emphasizing the critical role of
biomechanics in maintaining bone health and cellular functionality in extreme
conditions [39,40,41,43].

### 5.4. Kidney Cells

A recent study utilizing a microphysiological model of human renal proximal
tubules investigated the effects of microgravity on the cellular ability to
metabolize vitamin D and respond to human serum [44,45].

The findings revealed that short-term exposure to microgravity does not
significantly alter essential biochemical pathways in renal cells, indicating
that fundamental processes remain intact. In this experiment, renal proximal
tubule epithelial cells were cultured in a microphysiological system and
exposed to 2% human serum and vitamin D [25(OH)D3]. Biomarkers such as kidney
injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured to assess
cellular responses [44,45,46].

Transcriptomic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing, monitored vitamin D
metabolites and key genes involved in its metabolism, including CYP27B1,
CYP24A1, and CYP3A5 [44]. Surprisingly, no significant differences in vitamin
D metabolism were observed between microgravity and terrestrial conditions.
However, exposure to human serum elicited similar metabolic responses in both
environments, characterized by metabolic reprogramming, alterations in
bioenergetic processes, and the presence of a pro-inflammatory extracellular
environment [44,45,46].

One of the most striking observations was the differential regulation of over
2000 genes after exposure to human serum, regardless of gravitational
conditions. Affected pathways included the cell cycle, cytokine–cytokine
receptor interactions, and chemokine signaling [45]. Notably, a marked
reduction in the expression of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation
and fatty acid metabolism indicated diminished mitochondrial respiration,
suggesting a metabolic shift in kidney cells [45].

These findings imply that kidney cells, when exposed to human serum, redirect
their metabolism toward a proliferation-focused strategy, reducing reliance on
traditional energy pathways. Concurrently, significant changes in the
extracellular environment were observed, indicative of tissue remodeling. This
phenomenon was supported by the overexpression of genes related to the
extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN1) and transforming growth
factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI), as well as enzymes such as
metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), which are involved in remodeling and reorganizing
the cellular environment. These adaptations may represent a cellular response
to protein challenges in human serum or could signal underlying pathological
processes [44].

In addition to bioenergetic and extracellular matrix alterations, broader
metabolic reorganization signals were detected. Elevated cytosolic cholesterol
levels, inferred from the repression of genes regulated by the SREBF2 factor,
reflected shifts in intracellular metabolic balance. While these effects were
consistent across microgravity and terrestrial conditions, their significance
lies in demonstrating how human serum, as an external stimulus, can drive
profound cellular changes independently of gravity.

These results reinforce the notion that certain fundamental processes in renal
cells remain relatively stable under microgravity conditions during short-term
exposures. However, they also highlight the need for further research into
prolonged microgravity environments, where cellular adaptations may become
more pronounced or clinically relevant [44,45].

The implications of these discoveries are significant for both space
exploration and terrestrial medicine. In the context of spaceflight, the
findings provide critical insights into how kidneys might adapt to
microgravity, ensuring that essential functions such as filtration and blood
compound regulation are maintained during extended missions. On Earth, these
studies offer valuable perspectives on how kidney cells respond to metabolic
and protein stress, potentially informing the development of advanced
therapies for kidney diseases [44] (Figure 3).

### 5.5. Reproductive System Ovarian Follicles and Egg Quality

Simulated microgravity has provided valuable insights into how this unique
environment impacts egg quality and ovarian follicle development. Ovarian
follicles, which are critical for egg formation, rely on intricate
interactions between granulosa cells and the egg to ensure proper maturation.
However, the specific effects of microgravity on these interactions and the
overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be understood [47].

In an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were
cultured in a simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle
growth and survival rates were not significantly affected and remained
comparable to those observed under normal gravity conditions, the quality of
the eggs released was markedly reduced [47,48,49].

Electron microscopy revealed alterations in the cellular structures
responsible for communication between granulosa cells and the egg. These
structural changes resulted in a loss of organization within the granulosa
cells, disrupting the secretion of essential factors required for egg
maturation. However, supplementing growth factors and antioxidants
significantly improved egg quality, suggesting that the adverse effects of
microgravity could be mitigated through targeted interventions [47,48,49].

Further analysis of the eggs highlighted deficiencies in the distribution and
density of cortical granules, structures vital for maturation. Additionally,
there was a notable reduction in the number of eggs capable of releasing the
first polar body—a critical process in egg development. These deficiencies
were linked to increased oxidative stress levels, which further contributed to
the decline in egg quality [47,48,49].

Another key finding was the loss of polarity in granulosa cells, which
inhibited the formation of cellular projections essential for interacting with
the egg. This disruption impaired communication between granulosa cells and
the egg, negatively affecting the maturation process. Moreover, microgravity
altered the formation of microvilli in the egg, structures crucial for
interaction with surrounding cells. Eggs cultured under microgravity
conditions exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and size of
microvilli, potentially limiting their ability to release factors essential
for development [47,48,49] (Figure 3).

### 5.6. Cardiomyocyte Maturation and Functionality

Simulated microgravity has been shown to significantly enhance the maturation
and functionality of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.
One of the most notable improvements observed under these conditions is
mitochondrial biogenesis, a critical process for cellular maturation
[9,10,23,50]. Mitochondrial biogenesis enables cells to produce energy more
efficiently, a key factor for the proper functioning of mature cardiomyocytes.
Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial content,
evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated
ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. These findings suggest that
microgravity stimulates mitochondrial formation, improving the cells’ capacity
to generate ATP, the primary energy source for cardiac function [6,50].

In addition to increased mitochondrial content, simulated microgravity
enhances mitochondrial respiration. This improvement, evidenced by elevated
maximal respiration levels and ATP production, ensures the energy supply
necessary for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. These observations
highlight the potential of microgravity to promote metabolic maturation in
cardiomyocytes, rendering them more functional and suitable for therapeutic
applications [6,50].

Another critical aspect influenced by microgravity is calcium handling, a
vital process for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. Cells cultured
under microgravity exhibited greater amplitude in calcium transients,
reflecting enhanced calcium storage capacity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a
structure crucial for regulating intracellular calcium concentrations.
Efficient calcium handling is essential for effective cardiac function, as it
enables stronger and more coordinated muscle fiber contractions. These
findings indicate that cardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity are not only
more metabolically advanced but also display improved functionality consistent
with mature cardiomyocytes [6,50].

Simulated microgravity also positively affects the structural properties of
cardiomyocytes. Observations include increased sarcomere length, the
functional unit responsible for muscle contraction, and longer Z-disks, key
structures for transmitting contraction forces. Additionally, nuclear
eccentricity and diameter were increased, further indicating a higher degree
of cellular maturation. These structural enhancements bring cardiomyocytes
cultured in microgravity closer to the characteristics of fully functional
human cardiac cells, reinforcing their ability to perform physiological
functions effectively [6,50].

The duration of exposure to microgravity plays a pivotal role in maximizing
these benefits. Recent studies suggest that a 7-day exposure period is optimal
for promoting significant improvements in cardiomyocyte maturation. Prolonged
exposures of 14 days, however, did not yield additional benefits, indicating a
specific time window for maximizing the positive effects of microgravity.
Optimizing culture conditions within this timeframe is essential to achieve
the best outcomes [50,51].

Advances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte
maturation and functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine,
particularly for treating cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions. The
ability to produce high-quality, mature cardiomyocytes is critical for
developing effective cellular grafts capable of integrating into damaged
tissues and restoring cardiac functionality. These breakthroughs represent a
significant step forward in biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for
the treatment of cardiac pathologies [6,50,51] (Figure 3).

## 6\. Impacts on Stem Cells and Cell Regeneration

Microgravity has provided significant insights into how this environment
influences fundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and
cell repair [52,53]. Research conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial
simulations has demonstrated that microgravity impacts protein expression and
the regulation of cellular pathways critical for the growth and regeneration
of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways affected is the
Hippo pathway, which plays a central role in cell proliferation and tissue
damage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily
deactivated, creating a favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue
repair. These effects have shown particular promise in regenerating organs
such as the heart, with potential applications extending to other tissues
[53,54].

The replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new
possibilities for exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon
[17,52,53,54]. Findings suggest that microgravity could serve as a valuable
tool for enhancing the regenerative capacity of stem cells without requiring
invasive or complex technologies. Additionally, combining microgravity
exposure with the use of certain drugs or microRNA manipulation—key regulators
of gene expression—can amplify the activity of the Hippo pathway and YAP1
protein, further promoting tissue regeneration. These discoveries hold promise
for treating heart diseases and repairing other damaged tissues and systems
[53] (Figure 4).

### Figure 4.

Microgravity effects on stem cell differentiation and regenerative potential.
This figure illustrates key findings related to the effects of microgravity on
stem cell behavior. Microgravity has been associated with enhanced cell
proliferation, potentially contributing to tissue repair processes.
Additionally, it leads to the temporary deactivation of the Hippo pathway,
involving upstream regulators such as MST1/2, SAV1, WWC1-3, LATS1/2, and MOB1,
which in turn promotes the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore,
microgravity influences hematopoietic stem cell differentiation by activating
specific genes and pathways, including _RUNX1_ , which is involved in stem
cell establishment, _SOX17_ , which plays a role in maintaining pluripotency,
and _GATA3_ , which is crucial for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte maturation.
The PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways are also implicated in this process, with
STRIPAK acting as a modulatory factor.

Cells cultured under simulated microgravity using an RPM have shown
significant alterations, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to
gravity loss. For example, thyroid carcinoma cells (FTC-133) formed three-
dimensional spheroids, contrasting with their typical monolayer growth, and
displayed changes in adhesion properties and internal organization consistent
with spaceflight observations [23,24]. These morphological transformations
involved cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly affecting actin filaments
and microtubules, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Gene
expression analysis revealed changes in genes related to cellular adhesion and
proliferation, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
E-cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover, T lymphocytes exposed to RPM-simulated
microgravity exhibited decreased activation, mirroring the effects observed in
spaceflight experiments. These findings validate the utility of RPMs for
ground-based research on physiological changes relevant to long-duration
spaceflight [24].

### 6.1. Hematopoietic Differentiation

Simulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human
pluripotent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering a promising
avenue for regenerative medicine and cell therapies [55,56,57]. Under
microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem cells demonstrate more efficient
induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to improved formation
of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable increase
in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and
differentiation processes [55,56,57].

Transcriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of
thousands of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and
GATA1. RUNX1 is essential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for
maintaining pluripotency and differentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and
GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. These gene
expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates a favorable environment
for optimizing hematopoiesis [55].

At the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting
the expression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and
polymerases. This enhances efficient cell division, a critical factor for
hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore,
microgravity modulates the cell cycle, facilitating transitions through key
phases such as G1/S and G2/M, which are essential for cell proliferation
[55,56,57].

A key discovery is the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which regulates
cell growth, survival, and metabolism. This pathway modulates proteins such as
mTOR, which governs cell growth and metabolism, and Bad, which inhibits
apoptosis, ensuring the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. By
promoting cell proliferation and preventing programmed cell death, the
PI3K-Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of functional
hematopoietic cells [56,57].

Microgravity also enhances three-dimensional cellular organization, improving
interactions between cells and their microenvironment. These interactions are
vital for forming hematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions
more accurately. Cultures in microgravity favor the creation of three-
dimensional spheroids, which support better differentiation and functionality
of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis process. This
capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models
and innovative cell therapies [14,55,56].

Microgravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation,
proliferation, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased
proliferation, and improved structural organization, as microgravity optimizes
conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expansion [17,58,59,60,61,62]. This
occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway activation,
where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as BAD
and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity,
promoting β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear
translocation, activating genes essential for stem cell self-renewal and
differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch pathway
interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic
lineage commitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under
microgravity alter cell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression,
facilitating the three-dimensional organization of hematopoietic clusters. On
a physiological level, microgravity-induced metabolic adjustments enhance
responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoietic maturation. These
findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems to refine cell
culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflight’s effects on human
hematopoietic function [17,18].

### 6.2. Cell Proliferation and Regenerative Therapies

Microgravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality,
representing a transformative advancement for biomedical research and
regenerative medicine [63,64]. In studies with pancreatic islets and neural
crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity notably enhanced cell
proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For instance,
pancreatic beta cells exhibited a 45% increase in proliferation after two
weeks of microgravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity
conditions [63,65].

Microgravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific
functions. For example, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity
showed a significant increase in insulin secretion, suggesting potential
applications in developing therapies for metabolic diseases such as diabetes
[66]. Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets under
microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to
create a favorable environment for cell development [63,67].

The formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is a critical
aspect of these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more
accurately replicate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex
cell–cell and cell–environment interactions essential for differentiation,
proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D models not only
proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as
demonstrated by increased insulin secretion [63,66].

At the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling
pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival,
proliferation, and metabolism. While further studies are needed to confirm
their specific roles in beta cells and neural crest stem cells, these findings
underscore microgravity’s ability to influence fundamental processes and
optimize cell culture conditions [63,65].

Microgravity offers a unique environment that enhances cell proliferation,
viability, and functionality in 3D models, with direct applications in
regenerative medicine. This environment not only promotes cell growth but also
improves the functional quality of cells, which can significantly advance the
development of cell therapies. For instance, pancreatic islets cultured under
microgravity conditions could exhibit superior efficacy in transplants for
diabetes patients, demonstrating increased proliferation and functional
capacity, which could greatly enhance therapeutic outcomes [63,67].

## 7\. Impact on Pathogen Virulence

Microgravity, whether experienced during spaceflight or simulated in
terrestrial models, induces significant changes in the genetic expression and
physiology of pathogens affecting both humans and plants. These changes have
profound implications for astronaut health, space exploration, and the
prevention of foodborne illnesses in space environments [15,68,69].

### 7.1. Increased Pathogen Virulence and Resistance

Under microgravity conditions, bacterial pathogens such as _Salmonella
enterica_ and _Escherichia coli_ exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic
resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm formation. This is often accompanied
by a reduced median lethal dose (LD50) in animal models. For instance,
_Salmonella Typhimurium_ cultured under simulated microgravity demonstrated
fivefold higher lethality in mice compared to cultures grown under normal
gravity. Additionally, these pathogens have been observed to evade and
suppress plant innate immunity, enabling colonization of intracellular spaces.
While these processes are also observed on Earth, it remains unclear whether
microgravity enhances these capabilities or merely facilitates their study
[15,16].

### 7.2. Molecular Mechanisms Driving Virulence

Microgravity alters extracellular nutrient transport and activates molecular
pathways that enhance bacterial virulence. A key factor is low fluid shear, a
physical stimulus that mimics microgravity environments and is also present in
human microenvironments such as the gastrointestinal tract. Low fluid shear
conditions favor the expression of stress tolerance and virulence-related
genes, including those linked to the type III secretion system (TS3) and iron
metabolism regulation. For example, _Salmonella Typhimurium_ exposed to
microgravity shows increased tolerance to acidic conditions and upregulation
of genes controlled by Fur, a critical regulator of iron acquisition and
virulence in enteric pathogens [15,68,69].

### 7.3. Effects on Biofilm Formation and Stress Response

Microgravity also influences the transport of oxygen and phosphates due to the
absence of convection, replicating conditions similar to those in human
infections. These environmental changes impact gene expression related to
stress tolerance and virulence. For instance, _Escherichia coli_ demonstrates
enhanced biofilm formation and increased expression of genes responsible for
host cell adherence and lesion formation, thereby amplifying its pathogenic
potential. However, these effects are not universal; variations in results
suggest that the impact of microgravity depends on the pathogen type, culture
medium, and specific experimental conditions [15,16].

A recurring observation across multiple studies is the decreased expression of
Hfq, a key regulatory protein involved in stress response and virulence. Hfq
plays a critical role in the adaptation of both Gram-negative and Gram-
positive pathogens under stress conditions, including microgravity.
Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involving Hfq could provide insights
into mitigating the risks of pathogen virulence during prolonged space
missions [15,16].

Microgravity significantly affects interactions between human pathogens and
plants, increasing bacterial virulence and compromising plant defense
mechanisms. For example, pathogens under microgravity conditions demonstrate
an enhanced ability to suppress plant immune responses, facilitating
colonization and intracellular persistence [53,54,55,56,57]. These effects
underscore the importance of investigating pathogen behavior in extreme
conditions to develop strategies that mitigate health risks in space
environments [15,16].

## 8\. Discussion

Recent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide
array of biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation,
and tissue regeneration. This unique environment disrupts key mechanisms such
as mitochondrial biogenesis, liver metabolism, intestinal homeostasis, and
stem cell differentiation, with profound implications for human health,
particularly during prolonged space travel (Table 1).

Advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on stem cells, T cells,
and immune function have created new opportunities for therapeutic
innovations. Alterations in cellular biology under microgravity conditions
have been shown to affect diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney
dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes observed in endothelial
cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity’s potential
to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human
physiology in extreme environments.

Microgravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by
facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and
approaches to managing chronic diseases. These findings emphasize
microgravity’s transformative potential to reshape cellular biology and its
application to contemporary medical challenges, both in space and on Earth.

As a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes
profound and multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems,
challenging conventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence
of gravitational forces disrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to
health during and after space missions. Key effects include fluid
redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy, and calcium-
related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene
expression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant
consequences for energy production and cellular health [37,38,39].

In the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses
immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects
highlight the necessity of mitigating immune dysfunction during space travel.
Similarly, studies have documented changes in the human microbiome, with
potential implications for astronaut health and nutritional strategies during
prolonged missions.

Microgravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs
with applications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of
proteins and drug crystals under microgravity has produced purer and more
stable structures, offering new therapeutic possibilities for chronic
diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has contributed to the
development of innovative compounds with applications in both space and
terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency
of space missions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits
[39,40].

Despite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to
microgravity underline the need for further research, particularly in
anticipation of missions to Mars and other distant destinations. Experimental
models, such as space platforms and terrestrial simulators, remain
indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of microgravity
and developing effective countermeasures [37,49].

The study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human
body adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound
implications for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries
of what is known, this research establishes itself as a cornerstone for
advancements that extend beyond space exploration, reshaping our perspectives
on biology and human health [37,40].

## 9\. Conclusions

Microgravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology,
profoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This
environment, distinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological
functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration,
and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for
human health.

Emerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity,
including its impact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes,
increasing susceptibility to infections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit
altered behavior under microgravity, providing new insights into tumor
progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings underscore
the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease
mechanisms and treatment responses.

Microgravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver,
kidneys, and bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration.
Notably, stem cells exposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to
produce mature, functional cells such as cardiomyocytes, offering
transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine for repairing damaged
cardiac tissue and other applications.

The continued exploration of microgravity’s effects is essential not only for
safeguarding astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for
advancing therapeutic strategies on Earth. The ability of microgravity to
induce unique biological changes offers unparalleled opportunities to innovate
in regenerative medicine, cancer treatment, and the management of immune
dysfunctions.

By leveraging microgravity as a research platform, medicine and biotechnology
stand to gain transformative insights and novel applications, extending the
boundaries of our understanding of human biology and driving the development
of therapies that can improve health outcomes both in space and on Earth.
